A tuition class need to keep track of students’ attendance, progress and to manage their payments of 
monthly fees. The class currently keeps the name, address, telephone number, school, date of register 
and the fee type which is one out of the full or half, of the students. The progress of a student is 
measured by the number of Assessments completed by himself. An assessment has an assessment id 
(an integer within the range 1-10), date of submitted and a mark obtained by the student. An 
assessment is considered to be completed only if the mark is above 40%. Currently there is only one 
course conducted in the class which contains 10 assessments hence it is the maximum a student can 
submit. The tuition class require to list out the students’ progress against their names. 
The class needs to keep the information of a single batch of students. A batch is enrolled to the course 
which is conducted for 12 months. Each student should pay the monthly fee based on the fee type. A full 
fee worth Rs. 1000 and half fee worth Rs. 500. The class needs to calculate the total payment received 
for the given month as well as the total amount from the beginning to the current month of the current 
batch. Also, it is required to get a list of students who did not pay for the given month.
